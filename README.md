## Overview

Here you are my first solo project. It's the first one I face alone, without the help of an online course I can follow through.

It's simple, but it has helped me improve my use of the property flex and to realise that I have to practice more about media queries.

My biggest challenge here has been, precisely, creating a flexible design that adapted naturally to any screen size. It took me some time to figure how to keep elements where I wanted them to be.

### Built With
